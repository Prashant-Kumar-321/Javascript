## Lexical Environment: 
```
Lexical Environment is collection of local variables, function, parameters and their values

Every function has its lexical environment which is created when it is invoked

```

## Closure
```
Closure contains references to variables, functions defined in outer function lexical environment
It helps inner function retain the value of varibles of outer function and make inner function able to access them due to lexical scoping
